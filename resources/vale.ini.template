# If this is defined, Vale will re-build your site prior to linting any contentâ€”making it possible to use Sphinx
# and Vale in lint-on-the-fly environments (e.g., text editors) at the cost of performance.

# (unlike SkippedScopes, which are skipped entirely) but their content still won't raise any alerts.

# Specifies where Vale should look for its external resources (e.g., styles and ignore files).
# The path value may be absolute or relative to the location of the parent .vale.ini file.
# The styles path for Jenkins and Docker are different since both have different installation methods.  Docker
# places the styles path in '/styles' while Jenkins installs it in 'docs/styles'.  The mustache variable is
# replaced with the actual value used when you run 'make vale' or 'make tests'.  For more information, see the
# inner Makefile.
